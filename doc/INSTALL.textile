h1. How to install Know Thy Congressman (KTC)

h2. Get the Code from Git

We use git for managing our source code. Also note that this project contains
git submodules. This helps us control how we depend on external code, without
having to commit external code into this repository.

h3. Clone the repository

For the first time you clone the repository:

<code>
git clone git://github.com/sunlightlabs/know-thy-congressman.git
cd know-thy-congressman
</code>

For git projects that don't have submodules, that would be it. Because KTC
uses submodules, you will need to run two more commands:

<code>
git submodule init
git submodule update
</code>

h3. Getting repository updates

To get updates from the master branch:

<code>
git pull origin master
</code>

To check to see if you need to get submodule updates do this:

<code>
git submodule status
</code>

If you see one or more pluses (+) in the left-hand column, then it means that
your submodules need to be updated:

<code>
git submodule update
</code>

h2. Setup the Rails App

Know Thy Congressman (KTC) is an application built on Ruby on Rails.

To get your local installation working, you will need to follow the usual
steps, such as setting up your database.yaml file and any related database
commands.
